Observation 1: Southern Hemisphere climates are slightly milder than those at similar altitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere has more ocean and water helps cool down the temps. 

Observation 2: Highest temperature is between 0 and 20 latitude and as the latitude increase/decreases, the temperature drops. 

Observations 3: Latitude doesn't have a strong influence on wind speed. The speed of wind is controlled by the strength of the air pressure. The strong the pressure gradient, the higher the wind speed.
